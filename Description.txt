🚨 Automating Security: How I Built a Workflow to Convert GitHub Dependabot Alerts into Jira Tickets
A few weeks ago, my manager was frustrated with how often critical security alerts from Dependabot were being ignored by the dev team. These alerts are vital—they flag vulnerabilities in our dependencies—but they were getting buried in GitHub notifications.

So he asked me:
"Can we automate ticket creation for these alerts?"

Challenge accepted. 💪

🛠️ What I Built
I created a GitHub Actions + Bash Script workflow that runs daily and does the following:

Loops through multiple repositories to fetch open Dependabot alerts using GitHub's API.
Filters alerts by severity (critical and high) and status (open).
Checks Jira to avoid duplicate tickets using labels.
Creates detailed Jira bugs with:
Severity-based titles
Cleaned-up descriptions
Custom fields and labels for traceability
Parent linking and component tagging
The script is triggered via a scheduled GitHub Action (cron: '0 18 * * *') and uses secrets for authentication to keep credentials secure.

🧩 Challenges Faced
Initial Overload: At first, the script was creating tickets for all alerts—regardless of severity. This overwhelmed the Jira board and diluted focus. I refined the logic to only create tickets for critical and high severity alerts.
Duplicate Tickets: Tickets were being created multiple times for the same alert. I solved this by using a unique label format (repo-alertID) and querying Jira before ticket creation.
Messy Titles: Some summaries had special characters or were too vague. I added logic to sanitize and format them properly.
Authentication Issues: Managing GitHub and Jira tokens securely was tricky. I moved all credentials to GitHub Secrets and used environment variables in the workflow.
Rate Limits: GitHub API rate limits required batching and retry logic to avoid failures.
✅ Outcome
Now, every critical/high alert gets a Jira bug automatically, ensuring visibility and accountability. No more missed vulnerabilities. 🎯

This workflow has already helped our DevOps and Security teams stay ahead of potential threats—and saved hours of manual triaging.

💡 Takeaway
Sometimes the best solutions come from simple automation. If your team is ignoring alerts, maybe it's time to make them unignorable.
